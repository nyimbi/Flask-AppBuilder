This TreeMixin provides a robust implementation of a tree structure. Here's a breakdown of its features:

Parent-Child Relationship:

Uses SQLAlchemy's relationship to establish parent-child links.
The parent and children properties allow easy navigation of the tree.


Tree Traversal:

ancestors: Returns a list of all ancestors from root to immediate parent.
root: Returns the root node of the tree.
descendants: A generator that yields all descendants.
siblings: Returns a list of sibling nodes.


Tree Operations:

move_to: Allows moving a node to a new parent, with circular reference checks.
get_tree_representation: Returns a nested dictionary representation of the tree.


Utility Methods:

is_descendant_of, is_ancestor_of, is_sibling_of: Relationship checks.
depth: Calculates the depth of the node in the tree.
validate_tree: Checks for circular references in the tree structure.


Class Methods:

get_roots: Retrieves all root nodes.
get_nodes_at_depth: Finds all nodes at a specific depth in the tree.


SQLAlchemy Integration:

Uses declared_attr for dynamic attribute creation.
Implements hybrid properties for efficient database queries.


Flask-AppBuilder Compatibility:

Inherits from AuditMixin for tracking creation and modification.



To use this TreeMixin in your Flask-AppBuilder models:
```python
from flask_appbuilder import Model
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from tree_mixin import TreeMixin

class Department(TreeMixin, Model):
    __tablename__ = 'department'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(50), nullable=False)

# Usage example
def create_department_tree(session):
    root = Department(name="Company")
    hr = Department(name="HR", parent=root)
    it = Department(name="IT", parent=root)
    dev = Department(name="Development", parent=it)
    qa = Department(name="QA", parent=it)
    
    session.add_all([root, hr, it, dev, qa])
    session.commit()

    # Tree operations
    print(f"IT department depth: {it.depth}")
    print(f"QA ancestors: {[a.name for a in qa.ancestors]}")
    print(f"Company descendants: {[d.name for d in root.descendants()]}")
```
