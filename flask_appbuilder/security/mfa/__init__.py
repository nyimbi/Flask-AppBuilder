Flask-AppBuilder Multi-Factor Authentication Module

This module provides comprehensive multi-factor authentication capabilities
for Flask-AppBuilder applications, including TOTP, SMS, and Email MFA support
with backup codes and organizational policies.

Example Usage:
    from flask_appbuilder.security.mfa import MFASecurityManagerMixin
    from flask_appbuilder.security.mfa.services import TOTPService, SMSService
    
    # Enable MFA in your security manager
    class CustomSecurityManager(MFASecurityManagerMixin, SecurityManager):
        pass
    
    # Use MFA services
    totp_service = TOTPService()
    secret = totp_service.generate_secret()
    qr_code = totp_service.generate_qr_code(secret, 'user@example.com')

Dependencies:
    - pyotp: Time-based OTP generation and validation
    - qrcode: QR code generation for TOTP setup
    - cryptography: Secure secret storage and encryption
    - twilio: SMS delivery service integration
    - flask-mail: Email delivery for email-based MFA

Components:
    - models: Database models for MFA data storage
    - services: Business logic for MFA operations
    - views: Web interface for MFA management
    - manager_mixin: Flask-AppBuilder SecurityManager integration

Security Considerations:
    - All MFA secrets are encrypted at rest
    - Backup codes are hashed before storage
    - Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
    - Audit trails track all MFA operations
