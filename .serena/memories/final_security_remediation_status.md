- **CVE-2024-008** → Input validation gaps: ✅ Fixed with comprehensive framework

## Critical Issues Resolution (Code Review Findings)

### 1. ✅ CRITICAL: Flask Application Context Handling
**Fixed in**: `crypto_config.py:451-467`
- **Issue**: Runtime failures when modules imported outside Flask request context
- **Resolution**: Added proper `has_app_context()` checks and safe fallback patterns
- **Impact**: Prevents ImportError crashes in production environments

### 2. ✅ CRITICAL: SQL Injection Risk in Transaction Manager  
**Fixed in**: `transaction_manager.py:155-172`
- **Issue**: Potential SQL injection through isolation level parameter logging
- **Resolution**: Eliminated all f-string interpolation, used safe enum name logging
- **Impact**: Completely prevents information disclosure and injection vectors

### 3. ✅ HIGH PRIORITY: Department Hierarchy Integration
**Fixed in**: `secure_expression_evaluator.py:369-478`
- **Issue**: Critical approval routing features returned `None`, breaking workflows
- **Resolution**: Implemented real department head and cost center manager lookup with:
  - Multi-pattern department field support (`department_id`, `dept_id`, `department`)
  - Role-based manager identification (`DepartmentHead`, `Manager`, `CostCenterManager`)
  - Parameterized queries with proper error handling
- **Impact**: Enables production-ready dynamic approver assignment

### 4. ✅ HIGH PRIORITY: Memory Leak in Rate Limiting
**Fixed in**: `security_validator.py:61-177`
- **Issue**: Unbounded memory growth with in-memory rate limiting storage
- **Resolution**: Production-ready backend selection system:
  - **Redis Backend**: Automatic TTL, sorted sets for efficiency, pipeline operations
  - **Enhanced In-Memory**: Configurable limits, aggressive cleanup, memory pressure detection
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Backend selection based on configuration availability
- **Impact**: Prevents memory exhaustion in high-traffic production environments
