## 🔄 Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Automated quality gates run on:
- All pull requests
- Pushes to main/master/develop branches
- Manual workflow triggers

### Pre-commit Hooks

Local quality gates include:
- Syntax validation
- Code formatting (Black, isort)
- Security scanning (Bandit)
- Critical test execution
- Documentation coverage checks

Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

### Make Targets

```bash
make help                 # Show available targets
make quality-check        # Run all quality gates (permissive)
make quality-strict       # Run all quality gates (strict mode)
make syntax              # Check syntax only
make tests               # Run test suite
make docs                # Check documentation
make security            # Run security scans
make pipeline            # Run comprehensive validation
make quick               # Fast validation
make fix                 # Auto-fix common issues
